Highly customized Twitch chat bot being used by EmreCA. Made the repo public after many requests from my viewers.

The bot currently uses TMI.js so you may need to look at its docs on how to generate a oAuth token and so on. Without one, the code won't work. 
 
It pulls the tv show and movie data from Trakt.TV API. 

to do:
-!title and !game commands.
-viewers can change the color of philips hue lightbulbs by claiming a channel reward with their reward points.
