A highly customized Twitch chat bot being used by my Twitch channel EmreCA. Made the repo public after many requests from my viewers.

The bot currently uses TMI.js so you may need to look at its docs on how to generate a oAuth token and so on. Without one, the code won't work. Reading Twitch API docs would also help because the bot directly uses twitch api for some commands.
 
The bot pulls the tv show, movie and suggestion data from the Trakt.TV API. 

**to do:**

~~-!title and !game commands.~~
- add command timer
- viewers can change the color of philips hue lightbulbs by claiming a channel reward with their reward points.
- add an interface maybe?
